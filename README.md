# random-picker
Responsive web app to pick random numbers (range-based) or random names (list-based) with No-Repeat mode, history tracking, and CSV export.

# 🎲 Random Picker

Random Picker is a simple and clean web app that helps you quickly select:
✅ a random number from a range  
✅ a random name from a list  

I built this project to make lucky draws, attendance picking, and giveaways easier — without repeating results (if you enable *No Repeat* mode).

## ✨ What this app can do

### 🔢 Random Number Picker
- Enter a range (`From` and `To`)
- Click **Pick Number**
- It instantly generates a random number
- Includes input validation (to avoid wrong ranges)

✅ **No Repeat option**  
If enabled, the app will not repeat any number until every number in that range is picked.

### 👤 Random Name Picker
- Enter names (comma separated or one name per line)
- Click **Pick Name**
- It selects a winner randomly from your list

✅ **No Repeat option**  
If enabled, the picked name is removed from the list automatically.
